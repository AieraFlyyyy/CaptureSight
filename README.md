# CaptureSight

CaptureSight is a switch homebrew to view Sword and Shield data while playing the games.

Right now it's super barebones, and there are many improvments which can be made.

## Building

All libraries [listed in Plutonium's readme](https://github.com/XorTroll/Plutonium#what-is-plutonium), devkitPro, and libnx will be needed to build this tool.

After installing those, run `make`.
